## üìã About This Project

This portfolio website was **developed with the help of Loveable AI for initial scaffolding and coding suggestions, then fully manually edited, enhanced, and refined in Visual Studio Code** to ensure professional quality, pixel-perfect design, and optimal user experience.

It serves as a personal showcase of my projects, skills, and experience in a clean, visually attractive format optimized for desktop and mobile.
